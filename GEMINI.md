# Directory Overview

This directory contains the source code for a personal academic website. The site is built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a professional portfolio, showcasing academic work, projects, and contact information.

# Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the website. It contains the structure and content of the single-page layout.
*   `README.md`: Provides detailed instructions in French on how to set up and customize the website, including adding a CV and projects.
*   `assets/`: This directory contains the website's assets, including CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactive elements, and web fonts.
*   `cv/`: This directory holds the CV in both PDF and LaTeX formats, along with a PNG preview.
*   `images/`: Contains images used throughout the website, such as a profile picture and project-related visuals.
*   `projet_session/`: This directory is intended to house academic projects, with an example project in RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) and its HTML output.

# Usage

The contents of this directory are used to build and maintain a personal academic website. The `README.md` file serves as a guide for updating the site's content. To modify the website, you can edit the `index.html` file and the content within the `cv/` and `projet_session/` directories. After making changes, pushing the updates to the GitHub repository will automatically redeploy the site via GitHub Pages.
